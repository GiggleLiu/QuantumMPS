Dear Ling,

Thanks for your information, as well as your kind explanation of the mission and standard of PRX. 

Sorry for dwelling on this. But we do believe this work stands for a key contribution to the field of variational quantum circuits, which is one of the most promising direction in near-term application of quantum computers. This work meets the hight standards of PRX because it 

1. addressed the pressing issue of simulating large quantum systems with a limited number of qubits, 
2. addressed the fundamental issue of structure design of variational quantum circuits. Otherwise, the gradient vanishing problem in unstructured circuits has been one of the major obstacles to broad application of variational quantum computing to combinatorial optimization, machine learning and quantum chemistry problems.

After its appearance on arXiv and the first authors march meeting talk on this work, several leading experimental groups have expressed strong interests in the proposed scheme. It is our strong believe that, this paper, and subsequent experimental realizations, will be highly cited in coming years of quantum computing researches. We submit to your respected journal because of those considerations.  

We would be grateful if you reconsider our manuscript for review. Thank you very much! 

Best, 

Jin-Guo Liu for the authors
