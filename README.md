# QuantumMPS
Matrix product state (MPS) inspired quantum circuits for variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

Physical models includes: 1D and 2D Heisenberg model, with or without frustration, OBC or PBC,
Circuit Block ansatz includes: General, U(1) and SU(2) symmetric ansatz.

## Setup Guide
Set up your julia environment

* [julia 1.0+](https://julialang.org/)
* install required julia libraries: `Yao`, `DelimitedFiles`, `FileIO`, `Fire`, `JLD2`, `KrylovKit` and `StatsBase`. For example, to install `Yao`,
one can open a julia REPL and type `]` to enter the `pkg` mode, keep your internet connected and type
```julia console
pkg> add Yao
```

To access GPU, you need the extra packages: `CUDAnative`, `CuArrays` and `CuYao`.
Since `CuYao` has not been registered yet, please use
```julia console
pkg> dev CuYao
```
To install this CUDA extension for Yao.

Clone this repository [https://github.com/GiggleLiu/QuantumMPS.git](https://github.com/GiggleLiu/QuantumMPS.git) to your local host.

## Run an Example
As an example, we solve the ground state and get the ground state property of frustrated Heisenberg model with J2 = 0.5 on 4 x 4 lattice,
to run the training, one can type
```bash
$ julia j1j2.jl train --symmetry su2 --depth 1
```
Here, `symmetry` and `depth` are optional parameters to specify symmetry of ansatz and depth of circuit block.
The default symmetry is `su2` and the default circuit depth is 5.
The above training with default setting can be very very slow. Please turn on the GPU switch by setting `USE_CUDA = true` in file `applications.jl` if you have a GPU that supports CUDA. With GPU acceleration, models can be trained in 5-48 hours.

With or without GPU, you can calculate the correlation function and energy using pre-trained data in `data/`.
```bash
$ julia j1j2.jl trained szsz                    # Sz(i)*Sz(j) correlation matrix
$ julia j1j2.jl trained energy --symmetry su2   # sample energy expectation value
$ julia j1j2.jl trained fidelity --depth 1      # default depth is 5
```

To get help, you can type
```bash
$ julia j1j2.jl train --help
$ julia j1j2.jl trained --help
```
